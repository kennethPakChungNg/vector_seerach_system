VectorShop: Semantic Product Search System For Small-Middle Size Online Store

## Project Goal

To develop a production-ready semantic search system for small-middle size online stores, products dataset using the amazon products dataset from Kaggle, demonstrating the search system involve Reasoning LLM to give general capability that allow small-middle size online Store offer effective and efficient human language product vector search engine to their consumers for product discovery in low cost.

## Problem Statement

Traditional keyword-based search in e-commerce often fails to understand customer intent, leading to poor product discovery. And if small-middle size company wants to develop a well search engine will need to pay high cost and time. This project implements a generative vector search system which involve reasoning LLM such as deepseek R1 distil model and using amazon product data from Kaggle to show how vector search can improve product findability, lower the cost for online stores to apply.

## Datasets

1. Amazon Product Data Set from Kaggle

## Success Metrics

1. Search Quality:
    - Improved semantic matching demonstrated through example queries
    - Ability to handle Portuguese and English queries
    - Relevant results for similar products across categories
2. Technical Performance:
    - Search latency under 200ms
    - Efficient memory usage
    - Scalable vector storage implementation
3. Code Quality:
    - Well-documented, tested code
    - Clear project structure
    - Reproducible setup process
4. Easy to apply and low cost and resources
