The goal is to build a system that:\n","- **Constructs a combined text representation** for each product using product name, description, and customer review content.\n","- **Generates text embeddings** using a lightweight SentenceTransformer model (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).\n","- **Builds a FAISS index** for fast similarity search.\n","- **Performs query-based searches**, returning the most relevant products.\n","- **Applies filtering** (by price, category, and embedding distance) and **re-ranks results** using a re-ranking model (e.g., DeepSeek R1 Distill).\n","\n","This pipeline demonstrates a real-world solution for e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, where high-quality product search is critical. In addition to manual inspection of top search results, we evaluate the system using quantitative metrics (like precision@K) and enhance the presentation of results through custom formatting and export options.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Project Structure:**\n","\n","- **Data Files:**  \n","  The raw dataset is stored in `E-commerce_Analysis/data/raw/amazon.csv`.\n","\n","- **Python Modules:**  \n","  Reusable functions for vector search are located in `vectorshop/embedding/vector_search.py`.  \n","  Re-ranking functions using DeepSeek are in `vectorshop/data/language/utils/deepseek_rerank.py` (or in the `utils` folder).\n","\n","- **Notebooks:**  \n","  This notebook (`04_amazon_dataset_vector_search.ipynb`) demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline from data loading to evaluation.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Evaluation Strategy:**\n","\n","1. **Manual Inspection:** We will review the top search results for various queries to assess their relevance.\n","2. **Quantitative Metrics:** We will compute metrics such as precision@K, if ground-truth labels or user feedback are available.\n","3. **Enhanced Presentation:** We will adjust display options (e.g., using Pandas HTML formatting) to improve the readability of our output for stakeholder review.\n","\n","Let's begin by loading the data and constructing our combined text representation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15273,"status":"ok","timestamp":1740505967472,"user":{"displayName":"Kenneth

The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.   \n","2

                                                             Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product   \n","4  Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it's working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don't buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it's stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money   \n","\n","                                                                                                                       product_link  \\\n","0         https://www.amazon.in/Wayona-Braided-WN3LG1-Syncing-Charging/dp/B07JW9H4J1/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-1   \n","1     https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-2   \n","2      https://www.amazon.in/Sounce-iPhone-Charging-Compatible-Devices/dp/B096MSW6CT/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-3   \n","3   https://www.amazon.in/Deuce-300-Resistant-Tangle-Free-Transmission/dp/B08HDJ86NZ/ref=sr_1_4?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-4   \n","4  https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-5   \n","\n","                                                     image_url  \n","0  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ojkmsYe8L._SX425_.jpg  \n","1  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UzQMCRaeL._SX522_.jpg  \n","2  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31zuK8FlwnL._SX385_.jpg  \n","3  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RtLSD47FL._SY450_.jpg  \n","4  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617IU+aklGL._SX385_.jpg  \n","Device set to: cpu\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)\n","\n","import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","import sys\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","# Add project root directory to sys.path\n","project_root = Path(\"/content/drive/My Drive/E-commerce_Analysis\")\n","if str(project_root) not in sys.path:\n","    sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))\n","\n","print(\"Python path updated:\")\n","print(sys.path[:5])\n","\n","# Set display option for long text\n","pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)\n","\n","# Define the file path to your Amazon dataset with images\n","amazon_data_path = \"/content/drive/My Drive/E-commerce_Analysis/data/raw/amazon_with_images.csv\"\n","\n","# Verify file existence\n","if os.path.exists(amazon_data_path):\n","    print(\"Amazon dataset with images found!\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Amazon dataset with images not found.

The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.   \n","2

                                                             Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product   \n","4  Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it's working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don't buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it's stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money   \n","\n","                                                                                                                       product_link  \\\n","0         https://www.amazon.in/Wayona-Braided-WN3LG1-Syncing-Charging/dp/B07JW9H4J1/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-1   \n","1     https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-2   \n","2      https://www.amazon.in/Sounce-iPhone-Charging-Compatible-Devices/dp/B096MSW6CT/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-3   \n","3   https://www.amazon.in/Deuce-300-Resistant-Tangle-Free-Transmission/dp/B08HDJ86NZ/ref=sr_1_4?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-4   \n","4  https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-5   \n","\n","                                                     image_url  \n","0  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ojkmsYe8L._SX425_.jpg  \n","1  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UzQMCRaeL._SX522_.jpg  \n","2  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31zuK8FlwnL._SX385_.jpg  \n","3  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RtLSD47FL._SY450_.jpg  \n","4  https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617IU+aklGL._SX385_.jpg  \n","cpu\n","<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 1465 entries, 0 to 1464\n","Data columns (total 16 columns):\n"," #
